# BeatBox
Music maker in java
App Description :
Developing Music application called Cyber BeatBox in Java using which user can make sound patterns, when we hit 'Start' it playes the pattern until we hit 'Stop'.
At any time we can 'capture' one of our own patterns by sending it to the BeatBox server which means any other player can listen to it. 
User can also load any of the incoming patterns by clicking on the message that goes with it. 

Currently this version
1)UI is ready
2) we can save the pattern locally(by saving serialized objects and a file)
3) Demonstrates using FileOutputStream,ObjectOutputStream, FileInputStream, ObjectInputStream.
3) Java Swing Components
